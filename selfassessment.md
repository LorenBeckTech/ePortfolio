This professional self-assessment is my formal introduction to my portfolio, showing the knowledge and skills I've acquired and how they prepare me to excel in the field of computer science.

# Showcasing Strengths
Completing my coursework and developing the ePortfolio has allowed me to show off my strengths in different areas of computer science. For example, the capstone project enhancing the Shape Monster Game shows that I am proficient in multiple programming languages, advanced data structures, and software engineering principles. This project, along with others shows my ability to create high-quality, maintainable software solutions.

# Shaping Professional Goals and Values
Throughout the program, I have honed my professional goals and values. Working on group projects and collaborating with peers has emphasized the importance of teamwork. Also the process of testing and refining my projects has helped me with creating user-friendly and efficient solutions. My experiences have shaped my goal to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry while continuously evolving my skills.

# Preparing for the Computer Science Field
This BS in Computer Science Program has equipped me to tackle real-world challenges effectively. For example, converting the Shape Monster Game from Python to C++ demonstrated my adaptability and deepened my understanding of language-specific nuances. Integrating data structures like hash tables and unordered sets, and implementing CRUD operations for the to-do list, further honed my problem-solving skills. I have also developed a strong interest in working with SQL and data, which aligns with my current career as a contracting broker analyst.

# Collaborating in a Team Environment
Collaboration is very important for successful software development. During the program, I participated in numerous group projects that required clear communication, shared responsibilities, and collective problem-solving. Utilizing discussion boards and collaborating with peers and instructors helped me gain diverse perspectives and insights. Additionally, platforms like GitHub facilitated learning from others and sharing knowledge.

# Communicating with Stakeholders
Effective communication with stakeholders is crucial for successful project outcomes. My coursework included assignments that required presenting technical information to non-technical stakeholders, making sure their requirements and expectations were met. This skill is essential for bridging the gap between technical teams and clients, ensuring clear understanding and alignment.

# Data Structures and Algorithms
Understanding and implementing data structures and algorithms are fundamental skills in computer science. Enhancing the Shape Monster Game with hash tables and unordered sets allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in these areas. These skills are essential for creating efficient and optimized software solutions.
